# 🚀 Complete Survey Panel Guide - Everything You Need

## 📖 **Quick Overview**

Your survey panel is now **completely dynamic and interconnected** with all features working together. Here's everything you need to know to run and deploy it.

## ✅ **What's Been Fixed & Implemented**

### **🔧 Dynamic Interconnections**
- ✅ All pages use global state management
- ✅ Real-time updates across all components
- ✅ Analytics page fully dynamic with vendor performance
- ✅ Quotas page completely redesigned and dynamic
- ✅ Fraud detection generates alerts from actual data
- ✅ Settings streamlined for panel management

### **🔐 Authentication**

### **📊 Data Storage & Flow**

#### **How Data is Currently Stored:**
```
Development: localStorage (temporary)
Production: Supabase PostgreSQL database
```

#### **How Data Flows:**
```
User Action → PanelContext → Database → Real-time Updates → All Pages Update
```

### **🔗 Link Conversion System**

#### **How Client Links Become Panel Links:**

1. **Client gives you:** `https://client-survey.com/study/12345`
2. **You create project** with this link in panel
3. **Panel generates:** `https://surveypanel.com/start?project=P001&vendor=V001&uid=[UID]`
4. **You give this to vendors** who replace [UID] with their respondent IDs

#### **The 3-Redirect Flow:**
```
Vendor → Panel → Client Survey → Panel → Vendor (with result)
```

#### **Vendor Must Provide 3 URLs:**
- **Complete URL**: Where successful respondents go
- **Terminate URL**: Where unqualified respondents go  
- **Quota Full URL**: Where respondents go when survey is full
